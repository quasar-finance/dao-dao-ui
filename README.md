## DAO DAO UI

This project creates a web UI for the [DAO DAO smart
contracts](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts), enabling users to:

- create a governance token-based DAO, membership-based DAO (multisig), or other
  type of DAO.
- create and vote on proposals.
- view the treasury and manage it democratically.

All without having to code!

You can find more info in our [documentation](https://docs.daodao.zone). Join
the [DAO DAO Discord](https://discord.gg/sAaGuyW3D2) if you're interested in
becoming a contributor.

## Deployment with Vercel
Because of the server memory resource requirements for the build of this
application, we are using Github Actions to deploy this applcation to Vercel.

### Vercel Preview
- This workflow runs on any branch that isn't `main` and uses Vercel credentials to...
  - authenticate with Github Secrets,
  - pull preview build environment from Vercel,
  - build the packages on the Github Actions runner, and
  - deploy to preview the previously built packages.

### Vercel Production
- This workflow runs on branch, `main`, and uses Vercel credentials to...
  - authenticate with Github Secrets,
  - pull production build environment from Vercel,
  - build the packages on the Github Actions runner, and
  - deploy to preview the previously built packages.

## Development

### Clone this repo and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-dao-ui
cd dao-dao-ui
yarn
```

If you're here to work on UI components in isolation, you will likely want to
run the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) server to mock up components and
iterate quickly without having to access live chain data. Check out the
[storybook package README](./packages/storybook) for usage
instructions.

To start the Storybook server, run this command from the root of this monorepo:

```bash
yarn storybook start
```

If you're here to work on any other part of the app, likely accessing live chain
data, run the `yarn dev` script (equivalent to running `yarn dev` from the
[`./apps/dapp`](./apps/dapp) package) to run the main app in development mode.

```bash
yarn dev
```

If something is misconfigured, check out the docs for
[Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/docs), the monorepo build system we use.
